1.  I recomment creating a clean build environment:

    mkdir build
    cd build/
    
2.  Run cmake to configure the build environment and then make to build:
    
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
    make
    
3.  To install, use make install

    sudo make install

4.  Download prebuild binairy from the folder "Downloadables" in this rep

5.  Install it by coping file to wingpanel plugin folder as below.

    sudo cp libweather.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wingpanel/libweather.so
    pkill -9 wingpanel

6.  Get secret key from https://darksky.net/dev/login?next=/account and store it in your config file:
    
    cat ~/.weather.config
    {
        "key":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
